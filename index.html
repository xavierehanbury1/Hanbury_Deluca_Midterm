<h2>Why Halloween is more Fun</h2>
<p>While Christmas is known as the season of joy and jolly, Halloween has quite the edge up on it. Halloween has the brisk yet not too cold air of fall where as Christmas is filled with cold, biting snow that would make any man shiver in his boots. Halloween gives you free presents that no one you personally know has to pay for in the form of free treats, and it's a great excuse to practice cosplaying for your next comic-con. The seasonal pumpkin-based foods are also a lovely treat that only comes around so often per year; one could buy a thanksgiving or christmas turkey basically any time they wished. Halloween has better weather, less overall monetary cost to celebrate and truly brings out the mischevious whimsy in us all.</p>

<h2>Christmas is the Ultimate Holiday</h2>
<p>Although Halloween is an enjoyable holiday, Christmas is far superior for many reasons. First of all, Christmas is an opportunity to spend quality time with friends and family. Let's not forget about the food and drink as well. I'll take Christmas Eve seafood and Christmas Day turkey over candy any day.</p>

<p>Many people associate Christmas with giving and receiving gifts but I associate Christmas with family and story telling. It's an opportunity to learn about family history and traditions.</p>
