<h2>Why Halloween is more Fun</h2>
<p>While Christmas is known as the season of joy and jolly, Halloween has quite the edge up on it. Halloween has the brisk yet not too cold air of fall where as Christmas is filled with cold, biting snow that would make any man shiver in his boots. Halloween gives you free presents that no one you personally know has to pay for in the form of free treats, and it's a great excuse to practice cosplaying for your next comic-con. The seasonal pumpkin-based foods are also a lovely treat that only comes around so often per year; one could buy a thanksgiving or christmas turkey basically any time they wished. Halloween has better weather, less overall monetary cost to celebrate and truly brings out the mischevious whimsy in us all.</p>
